## Fish Tank Automation

This project is intened to automate the process of refilling and adding water to fish tanks.  
It uses a [adafruit feather Huzzah] (https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821) to control two normally closed solinoids.

The soliniod is opened by one of two way:
<ol>
  <li>A float switch that drops below the set level</li>
  <li>At the set time to cycle the tanks on a schudule</li>
</ol>
  
 In this example only tank A has a float switch but it could be added to all if the tanks if desired.
